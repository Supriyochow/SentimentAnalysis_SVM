We have been given a data of the Tweets by customers of US Airlines with sentiments. The task is to do sentiment analysis about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

We will be using Support vector Machines for performing the sentiment Analysis.
